Wondering where your JS code is? You probably haven't run the proper gulp command to generate it.

You can compile your code that lives in the 'js/src' directory by doing the following:

  1) Navigate to the themekit directory in your terminal
  2) Run 'npm install'
  3) Run 'gulp scripts'

You can also run 'gulp watch' to have gulp watch your source files for
any changes.
